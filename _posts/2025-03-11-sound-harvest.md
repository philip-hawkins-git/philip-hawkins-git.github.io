Sound Harvest’s origins can be traced back to my wife’s birthday. We were dead broke at the time, but I couldn’t just shrug my shoulders and say “sorry about it this year, hun.” If I couldn’t buy her something, then I would make her something. She had an .mp3 player that she wanted to update with new content. Unfortunately, the YouTube to .mp3 sites were either constantly down or filled with slime. That’s when I came up with the code that would become Sound Harvest. 

Sound Harvest is an extremely user-friendly YouTube to .mp3 converter. Simply paste a YouTube url into the video_url field and hit play and in less than a minute you'll have an .mp3 file located in your Colab's Files directory (🖿 located to the left) for you to download to your local drive.
