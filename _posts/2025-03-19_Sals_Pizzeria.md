One of my favorite aspects of working with generic datasets is creating fictional backstories for the study. For this project, I used the Pizza Sales dataset from Kaggle and invented a character named Sal, who owns a restaurant called Sal's Pizzeria. In my story, Sal hired me to conduct a data-driven analysis of his best and worst-selling pizzas. The underperformers will either be removed from the menu or offered as limited-time specials. While this is the fictional backdrop, my real aim was to explore the creative and aesthetic aspects of data visualization. I wanted to blend the look of a pizza menu with data on menu items, and I'm pleased with the results.
