One of my favorite things about working with generic datasets is making up a fictional back story for the study. In this case, I took the [Pizza Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/pizza-sales) dataset from Kaggle, and invented a guy named Sal. Sal owns a pizza restaurant called Sal's Pizzeria. In my story, Sal hired me to do a data-driven study of his best and worst selling pizzas. The losers will either be scrapped from the menu or made into limited time offers. That's the fictional backstory. The real reason for me making this data viz is to focus on the more creative and aesthetic dimension of data viz. In this visual, I wanted to combine the aesthetic of a pizza restaurant's menu with data about the menu items. I am happy with the results.
